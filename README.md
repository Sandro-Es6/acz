Small project showcasing a few characters from Ace Combat Zero, with a background video.

(issues with iOS Safari at the very bottom of page)

Built without an external framework, I'd only used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6. 
Layed out with Flexbox, utilized Intersection Observer for fade-in/out effects, and CSS3 for styling/presentation. 
Text & images are responsive for mobile view. 
Tested using Playwright Test for VSCode, super helpful.
Added vendor prefixes for mozilla and webkit.

Initially, I was planning on using Grid for the layout, but realized Flexbox is more appropiate for the desired layout, especially when viewed on a mobile device.  

As for a wishlist of things to add in the future, I do plan to recreate the website with React once I learn more JavaScript and React. 
Additionally, I need to debug the flag picutres not showing correctly on iOS Safari.
